## TODO:
- [ ] Add a new Public IP for ingress load-balancer > We're limited by the Trial Subscription.
- [ ] Restrict accessing the LB IP through Azure Front Door only.
- [ ] Restrict ingress requests to have the proper Azure Front Door ID. It doesn't provide security on its own. IP access restriction is alwo required.
